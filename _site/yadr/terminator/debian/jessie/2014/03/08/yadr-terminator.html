          <h2>YADR in Terminator</h2>
<p class="meta">08 Mar 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I&#39;m been using GNU/Linux for almost 10 years and helping friends install it on
their computers.  Recently I tried out Lubuntu for something lightweight.  The
sability hasn&#39;t been so good for me and, shock horror, it crashed a few times.
Seemed time to switch distros, I went for Debian Jessie.  When you switch
distros I find one of the most painful things is transferring your settings /
dot files.</p>

<h1>yadr</h1>

<p>I&#39;ve been pairing with a friend on his Mac and he used yadr so I thought I
should try it out.  It is a collection of dot files that adds great
functionallity to your terminal and vim (probably more things but I haven&#39;t
fully explored it all yet).  On Lubuntu it didn&#39;t work out of the box so I&#39;m
mainly writing this to make the installation processes easier in future and
help any one else who has the same issues.</p>

<p>I use Terminator because of its split screen feature and it has all the
options I need.  Except... on my firends iTerm if you command click on a file
link (in an rspec error message for example) you are taken to the file and 
line number in your editor of choice: vim!</p>

<p>After installing yadr</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the colours in vim are messed up so I went to Prefrences -&gt; Profiles -&gt; Colors and set the scheme as &quot;Solarized Dark&quot; and the pallet as &quot;Solarized&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>the powerline fonts seemd hard to get working.  I tried following the readme docs and installing the &quot;for Powerline&quot; fonts and patching fonts but the status bar still had 
little squares with numbers inside and not the nice powerline symbols.  Turns out I didn&#39;t have the right fonts, I need to download:
<code>cd ~/.fonts/ &amp;&amp; git clone https://github.com/scotu/ubuntu-mono-powerline.git &amp;&amp; fc-cache -vf ~/.fonts</code></p></li>
<li><p>the default font in gvim was bad, really bad so in <code>~/.vimrc</code> I added:</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">if has(&#39;gui_running&#39;)
  set guifont=Monospace\ 10
endif
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><p>setting gvim to save when focus is lost on a window (e.g. you click away) stops you having to type <code>:w</code> all the time so I also add:
<code>:au FocusLost * :wa</code></p></li>
<li><p>it is a bit annoying that the Sneak plugin remaps &#39;S&#39; so I also deleted these lines (295-297) from &quot;.yadr/vim/bundle/vim-sneak/plugin/sneak.vim&quot;
<code>
if !hasmapto(&#39;&lt;Plug&gt;SneakBackward&#39;) &amp;&amp; !hasmapto(&#39;&lt;Plug&gt;Sneak_S&#39;, &#39;n&#39;) &amp;&amp; mapcheck(
nmap S &lt;Plug&gt;Sneak_S
endif
</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>On Debian I also wanted to remap the keyboard so CapsLock and Escape were switched </p>
